<h6>Our Paradise in Under Construction</h6>
<br><br>
There are as many paradises as there are people. The background of the word is biblical, but its meaning has changed throughout the years to mean a more secular, utopy-like place. However, the paradise imagined is always being transformed and its meanings change. 
<br><br>
Paradise is often called the holiest place, where the eternal happies and delight reside. Eternity might be lived there. Homo Sapiens lives there in balance with the rest of the nature. <br><br>
Everything is always under construction. Cities, Otaniemi Campus, our own lives and identities, our friendships and romances, our hopes and fears, our future and relationship with the past. How we see history and how we imagine future are under construction.
<br><br>
We can imagine our own paradises and use our best of knowledge and skills to make the world we live in into a paradise. Until then, it's under construction.<br><br><br>
<h6>PARADISE UNDER CONSTRUCTION</h6>
<br><br>
Edit. Okay so we got some feedback that this text was too romantic and not over the top enough for the biggest party of the year so here's an extra paragraph to get your spirits up:
<br><br>
Let's push the boundaries of what is possible and put those 3D printers that are always collecting dust in VÃ¤re to good use. Make friends with a fashion student or two, go to Estonia to get some good fabrics. Fire hazards? Yes. Loud. Multiple outfits in one night. Watch a fashion show, here's a link: <a href="https://www.vogue.com/">www.vogue.com</a> Let's put the met gala to shame within the constraints of a kela-less student budget. See you in November. (this was here already last year, but we loved it and wanted to leave it for you to remember)
<br><br><br>
